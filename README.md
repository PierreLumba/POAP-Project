# POAP Project

## Overview
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) built on blockchain technology, leveraging the Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) to track and validate attendance at various events.

## Features
- **Smart Contracts**: Built with Solidity to track event attendance and issue POAP tokens.
- **Web Interface**: A front-end interface allowing users to interact with the smart contract and mint POAP tokens.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS Storage**: Stores metadata and files related to events and POAP tokens on IPFS.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts.
- **Web3.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized file storage.
- **JavaScript**: For front-end interactions.
